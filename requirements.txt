# Notes:
# - Deploying DeepFace on Streamlit Cloud can be resource-heavy (TensorFlow + model downloads).
#   If you want to avoid heavy downloads, set the environment variable `DISABLE_DEEPFACE=1`
#   in the Streamlit app settings (Advanced -> Environment variables) so the app uses the
#   lighter fallback backends.
# - To pin exact versions from your environment, run:
#   python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
